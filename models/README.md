For the link, here is the skeletal structure of our robot and some of the vital parts of it and the step by step on how we build the skeletal structure of our Robot.

# MODIFICATION 1
For modification #1, we changed the page 46-49 and use a Rudder angle (Red) in order to generate a speed that we wanted for the robot to perform.

# MODIFICATION 2
For modification #2, we added the top Vision camera, Rudder angle (Gray) and the Grayscale sensor of the robot.

# MODIFICATION 3
For modification #3, we modify the build of the front part of the robot allowing us to put the camera, the rudder angle, as well as the sensor. Also, because we modify the front part of the robot, now the robot can turn easily in any direction because of the rudder angle and the use of camera.

# MODIFICATION 4
For modification #4, we put the battery and the Nashenbot microcontroller. Also, in modification 4, we do the cable management for our robot.

# MODIFICATION 5
For modification #5, we added the design for the robot.
