# MAYABOT-ROBOMATION TOP VIEW
In the top view of our Robot, you will see the whole structure of the robot as well as the controller whereas you will see the wires/cables that are attached to it such as: the white cable for the camera, 
the two rudder angle, the gray scale sensor. Also, you will see the 4 wheels that are responsible for moving the Robot in precise manner. The two Black tire that placed on the rear part of the for moving 
forward and the two black wheels that are responsible in turning.

# MAYABOT-ROBOMATION FROMT VIEW
In the front of our Robot, you'll immediately notice the top vision camera that act as an eye for the robot allowing it to detect some obstacles and perform a 
specific function. In the below of the camera, you will notice a grayscale sensor positioned in the lower middle to detect a specific colors(orange and blue) and if
it detects a specific color, it will either turn left or right. The robot has a two black rubber wheel for maintaining the balance of the robot connected to a (gray) rudder angle motor
that was responsible when it comes on turning.

# MAYABOT-ROBOMATION REAR VIEW

In the rear view of our Robot, you will see the 2 black tires and a red rudder angle motor responsible for moving forward and generating the speed of our robot.
The two wheels are connected into the motor as we wanted in order to give us an advantages on speed.

# MAYABOT-ROBOMATION SIDE VIEW LEFT 
At the left side of our robot you can see both of the wheels at the left side that is securely attached to the robot as well as the connection of the battery to the main hub of the robot to power all the motors and sensors.

# MAYABOT-ROBOMATION SIDE VIEW RIGHT 
At the right side of the robot we now see how the wheels on the right side is also securely attached to the robot and now you will also see the wirings for both the rudder angle and the red motor at the back as well as the camera of our robot that enables it to avoid obstacles.

# MAYABOT-ROBOMATION BOTTOM VIEW
In the bottom view of our Robot, you will see the base structure of our Robot that are connected. Also, you will see the battery on the middle and the structure of the front wheel on how it will turn.
